# Branch Naming for PRs

When creating pull requests, use descriptive branch names with appropriate prefixes:

## Branch Naming Rules:
- Use `feature/` prefix for new features, enhancements, or additions
- Use `fix/` prefix for bug fixes, corrections, or patches
- Follow the prefix with a short, kebab-case description of the change (e.g., `feature/add-combat-system`, `fix/nlu-parsing-error`)
- Keep branch names concise but descriptive (2-4 words typically)
- Do NOT use random strings or UUIDs in branch names

## Examples:
- `feature/add-inventory-system`
- `feature/improve-nlu-confidence`
- `fix/combat-damage-calculation`
- `fix/session-timeout-issue`
- `feature/map-generation-optimization`

## Determining Prefix:
- **feature/**: New functionality, new modules, new features, enhancements, improvements
- **fix/**: Bug fixes, error corrections, addressing issues, patching problems
