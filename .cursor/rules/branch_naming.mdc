# Branch Naming Convention for Pull Requests

When creating pull requests or branches, ALWAYS use descriptive branch names with appropriate prefixes. Never use random strings, UUIDs, or date-based random names.

## Branch Naming Rules:

- Use `feature/` prefix for new features, enhancements, or additions
- Use `fix/` prefix for bug fixes, corrections, or patches
- Follow the prefix with a short, kebab-case description of the change
- Keep branch names concise but descriptive (2-4 words typically)
- DO NOT use random strings or UUIDs in branch names
- DO NOT use date-based random names like `2025-11-09-xymn-3d16b`

## Examples:
- `feature/add-cursorrules-config`
- `feature/improve-nlu-confidence`
- `fix/combat-damage-calculation`
- `fix/session-timeout-issue`
- `feature/map-generation-optimization`

## Determining Prefix:
- **feature/**: New functionality, new modules, new features, enhancements, improvements, configuration files, documentation
- **fix/**: Bug fixes, error corrections, addressing issues, patching problems

## Pull Request Titles:

PR titles should **NOT** be the same as the branch name. PR titles should:
- Be descriptive and human-readable
- Clearly explain what the change does or fixes
- Use title case or sentence case (not kebab-case)
- Focus on the "what" and "why" of the change
- Be more detailed than the branch name when needed

### PR Title Examples:
- Branch: `feature/add-branch-naming-guidelines` → PR Title: "Add branch naming guidelines for PRs"
- Branch: `feature/improve-nlu-confidence` → PR Title: "Improve NLU confidence scoring and threshold handling"
- Branch: `fix/combat-damage-calculation` → PR Title: "Fix incorrect damage calculation in combat system"
- Branch: `fix/session-timeout-issue` → PR Title: "Fix session timeout not respecting TTL configuration"
- Branch: `feature/map-generation-optimization` → PR Title: "Optimize map generation algorithm for better performance"

## Important:
When the user requests to create a PR or when automatically creating branches for PRs:
1. Analyze the changes to determine if it's a `feature/` or `fix/`
2. Create a descriptive branch name based on the actual changes (kebab-case, 2-4 words)
3. Create a separate, more descriptive PR title that explains the change clearly
4. The PR title should be different from and more descriptive than the branch name
5. Use kebab-case for branch names, but title/sentence case for PR titles
