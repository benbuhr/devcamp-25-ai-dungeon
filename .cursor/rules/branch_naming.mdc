# Branch Naming Convention for Pull Requests

When creating pull requests or branches, ALWAYS use descriptive branch names with appropriate prefixes. Never use random strings, UUIDs, or date-based random names.

## Branch Naming Rules:

- Use `feature/` prefix for new features, enhancements, or additions
- Use `fix/` prefix for bug fixes, corrections, or patches
- Follow the prefix with a short, kebab-case description of the change
- Keep branch names concise but descriptive (2-4 words typically)
- DO NOT use random strings or UUIDs in branch names
- DO NOT use date-based random names like `2025-11-09-xymn-3d16b`

## Examples:
- `feature/add-cursorrules-config`
- `feature/improve-nlu-confidence`
- `fix/combat-damage-calculation`
- `fix/session-timeout-issue`
- `feature/map-generation-optimization`

## Determining Prefix:
- **feature/**: New functionality, new modules, new features, enhancements, improvements, configuration files, documentation
- **fix/**: Bug fixes, error corrections, addressing issues, patching problems

## Important:
When the user requests to create a PR or when automatically creating branches for PRs:
1. Analyze the changes to determine if it's a `feature/` or `fix/`
2. Create a descriptive branch name based on the actual changes
3. Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
4. Keep it short but meaningful
